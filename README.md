# Digital-Clock-Project-

This project is a clock that displays the time and date on seven segment led displays. Two buttons are used to set the time and date. The program takes care of changing the date andkeeping track of leap years. In this project, we have built a digital clock with 12 hour count time. The clock runs from 00:00 to 11:59 and then back to 00:00.
